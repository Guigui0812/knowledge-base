There's a lot of commands available on Cisco devices. Here's a list of the most used commands to configure a Cisco switch or router. This article is more a cheat sheet than a real article that I use to remember the commands.

# Classical commands

There a lot of commands to know when you work on Cisco devices. Here's a list of the most used commands to configure or troubleshoot a Cisco device.

## Basic configuration commands

These commands are used to configure or to show the configuration of the device. They are used very often and are the most important commands to know. I use them nearly every time I configure a Cisco device.

| Command | Purpose  |
|------|-----|
|`enable`|Logs in privileged mode|
|`reload`|Reboots the device|
|`hostname <name>`|Sets the hostname|
|`configure terminal` <br> `conf t`|Logs in global configuration mode|
|`show running-config` <br> `show run`|Prints the current configuration|
|`show version`|Prints the current version of the device|
|`show ip interface brief`|Prints a summary of the interfaces|
|`interface <interface>` <br> `int <interface>`|Interface configuration mode|
|`interface range <interface1> - <interface2>` <br> `int range <interface1> - <interface2>`|Accéder à plusieurs interfaces (**example** : `int range fa0/1 - 24`)|
|`copy running-config startup-config` <br> `copy run start` <br> `write mem`|Saves the current configuration|
|`erase startup-config` <br> `erase start`|Erases the current configuration|
|`ip address <ip> <mask>`|Sets the IP address and mask|
|`ip default-gateway <ip>`|Sets the default gateway|
|`shutdown`|Disables the interface|
|`no shutdown`|Enables the interface|
|`description <description>` <br> `desc <description>`|Sets the description of the interface|

## Troubleshooting commands

When there is a problem in the network, these commands are very useful to troubleshoot the problem. They are used to check the status of the interfaces, the routing table, the ARP table, etc.

| Command | Purpose  |
|------|-----|
|`ping <ip>`|Pings the IP address|
|`show ip interface brief`|Prints a summary of the interfaces|
|`show interfaces` <br> `show int`|Display statistics for all interfaces configured on the device|

|`show interfaces switchport`|Prints configuration information about the interfaces (trunk, access, etc.)|
|`show ip route`|Prints the routing table|
|`show int status`|Prints the status of the interfaces|
|`show ip int description`|Prints the description of the interfaces|
|`show ip arp`|Prints the ARP table|
|`show cdp neighbors`|Prints the CDP neighbors|
|`show cdp neighbors detail`|Prints the CDP neighbors with more details|
|`show mac address-table`|Prints the MAC address table|
|`show vlan`|Prints the VLANs|
|`show vlan brief`|Prints a summary of the VLANs|
|`show spanning-tree` <br> `show span`|Prints the spanning-tree information|
|`show spanning-tree vlan <vlan>` <br> `show span vlan <vlan>`|Prints the spanning-tree information for a specific VLAN|
|`show vtp status`|Prints the VTP information|
