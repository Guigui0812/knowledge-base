# My personnal knowledge base and wiki

This is a personnal wiki and knowledge base. It is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator.

On this website, you can find some tutorials and explanations about Linux, sysadmin, security, programming, etc. I note here some things that I learn and that I want to remember. I also write some tutorials to help other people.
